## 📝 S&P Project Notes

- Use the **Snowflake credentials** you previously shared with me.
- Use your **OpenAI API credentials** for the LLM.
- The full job will take approximately **10 hours to run** if there are around **30,000 instances** in the database.
- A **faster approach** using **semantic similarity** is available — it significantly reduces runtime but is **less accurate** when reconstructing the original document.
- Run docker postgresql with **docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d**
